A fork of https://github.com/gbl/AntiGhost/tree/forge_1_12-auto but requests fewer blocks and runs on a timed interval. Original code by gbl. (https://github.com/gbl/)
This mod unfortunately also breaks some vanilla blocks that can't be placed on a given block, for example grass or flowers atop sand or gravel. A future release might fix this at some point.
